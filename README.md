# Facebook integration in Liferay

## Motivation
More and more often, every virtual entity also has a facebook page (companies, communities, bands...). Facebook pages are very limited and people also need another website (for example, one built in Liferay) but then you have some staff in your website, some staff in Liferay... and your users may not know where to go. This project wants to provide the mechanisms to make easier integration of a Liferay Site with a Facebook page.

## Goals of the project
This project will benefit site administrators who maintain a website built in Liferay and a **facebook page** linked to that website. It will also benefit end users since they will be able to interact with their website both from facebook or Liferay.

Initially, this project contains some plugins (portlets) for having the **facebook social apps** (comments, like boxes... etc)

Some developments to come:

* Integration of the openGraph protocol
* Integration of facebook comments on top of liferay comments
* Automatic integration of Sites with Facebook pages
* ...
* ?

Below there are some screenshots of the current portlets that are available:
